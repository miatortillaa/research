            Adobe After Effects was introduced over 28 years ago. The first version of Adobe After Effects came out in January 1993. 
            It was a very basic version, with it only being able to do layered compositing with masks, keyframes, effects, and transforms.
            It was only available on mac at first. The code name for the first version was egg. CoSa was the developer for the first two versions (1.0 and 1.1) 
            however, the software firm Aldus developed version 2.0 and 2.0.1. Those versions included new effects. Version 2.0 included image sequence support, 
            multi-machine rendering, frame blending, proxies, time layout window, motion blur. The code name for this one was teriyaki. Version 2.0.1 only added one new feature 
            called Power Macintosh Version (PPC). These were the very first versions, After Effects was later handed over to Adobe and they’ve been overseeing this program ever since. 
            I haven’t been able to find anything at the price of the first version, but if it’s anything like the newest version, it was a little bit expensive.
