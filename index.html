    <h1>This is a research page on the milestones in Adobe After Effects</h1>
    <p>Adobe After Effects in a computer program that is used in television production,

        Adobe After Effects was introduced over 28 years ago. The first version of Adobe After Effects came out in January 1993. 
        It was a very basic version, with it only being able to do layered compositing with masks, keyframes, effects, and transforms.
        It was only available on mac at first. The code name for the first version was egg. CoSa was the developer for the first two versions (1.0 and 1.1) 
        however, the software firm Aldus developed version 2.0 and 2.0.1. Those versions included new effects. Version 2.0 included image sequence support, 
        multi-machine rendering, frame blending, proxies, time layout window, motion blur. The code name for this one was teriyaki. Version 2.0.1 only added one new feature 
        called Power Macintosh Version (PPC). These were the very first versions, After Effects was later handed over to Adobe and they’ve been overseeing this program ever since. 
        I haven’t been able to find anything at the price of the first version, but if it’s anything like the newest version, it was a little bit expensive.

        Adobe's first version had the code name Nimchow, and it was introduced in October of 1995. Its key features were render queue, multiple effects per layer, advanced keying, continuously rastersize illustrator files, 
        motion maths, velocity graph, time remapping, bezier masking, and 1/2/4 point motion tracking. When adobe was able to create after-effects, they added manu features that could be 
        imported from photoshop illustrator becuase they were both products belonging to adobe.

        Adobe continued to add new features to after effects, but in May 1997, they released the first windows version, and the first german and french version. The code name of that
        version was dancing monkey. It added features like path text and animated gif output. They also released version 5.5 on january 7th, 2002. The code name was Fauxfu and it was 
        the first OS X version.

        In 2007, they released version 8.0, and after effects finally got its first logo. The code name was metaloaf, and it added a whole lot of new features. On May 29th 2009 (version 9.0.2)
        and on April 8, 2011 (9.0.2) they got another logo.

        There are things called After Effects Plug-ins. They are used to extend the functionally of After Effects. It allows more features you would get with the regular After Effects, such 
        as particle systems, 3d effects, physics engines, and the ability to connect after effects and another application. After Effects are a number of commands written in both extendscript
        language and javascript language. Unlike plug-ins, they are developed to automate repetitive tasks. Adobe tends to release new versions of After Effects every few months, and they
        always include new features to try out.
